![Design preview for the Calculator app coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out how this front end mentor challenge is going:

Here's the breakdown so far:

June 3rd, 2021:
    1- Custom Bootstrap html file created to match calculator challenge
    2- Created CSS / JS Files
    3- Calculator is now styled with first CSS theme
      a. Need to figure out how to create a theme switcher slider
      b. How to implement more themes
      c. https://codepen.io/michellebarker/pen/GzzrGJ has a good theme switcher, however its only 2. how can I make it three?
    4- JS is now detecting keystrokes on the numpad (on the keyboard) and changing the innerHTML of the output window, however they are not concatenated.


## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this calculator app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

The users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## Where to find everything

The task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design.

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.

If you would like the design files (we provide Sketch & Figma versions) to inspect the design in more detail, you can [subscribe as a PRO member](https://www.frontendmentor.io/pro).

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.
